           What is the secret to building an excellent looking physique? Nobody has it, and whoever 
           claims that knows it is lying to himself and others.The truth is that every single human
            being is different. So, we should expect a different approach when  dealing with people
            who want to build a beautiful looking body. However, we do share some basic stuff.
            Like for example; we all can burn fat or build muscle. Now, from people to people,
            this principle varies. Some people can build muscle faster or burn fat more natural, but no matter 
            what category you fall in getting the result is a matter of consistency and perseverance.I am 
            not here to tell you I know a lot of stuff, and I have 20 plus years of experience or any other
            lie that we all hear very often. I am here to help "you" to whatever goal you may have. I want 
            you to have this clear. I am here for you. Of course, I have bills and people who depend on me,
            so yes, I need money too, but that does not mean I will rip you off at any cost. It means that 
            I will care for you because my success depends only on you.

                Now, I want you to think about your purpose. What do you want, what are you seeking. What drives
                you to wake up every morning or afternoon and keep you fighting. I want you to think deeply about
                that because that will be the primary source of energy you'd have whenever you feel defeated or
                tired. Along the way I'd be there for you, not only to give routines of exercises or what to 
                eat or what supplements buy. I'd be there to hear from you to help you. Remember, my main concern
                is you; my success is you.
