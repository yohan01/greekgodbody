       <p class='secret'>I remember I started my journey at the age of 12. Yes, I was only 12 years old.<br> It is essential to mention that back in my birth 
        country, Cuba, things were slightly different from here. Kids from that age are already<br>  doing more than they should do, but in my case,
        I focused on working out and trying to get an appealing body that girls would like to<br>  look and feel as well â€” a Greek god body. Still,
        I had no idea what I was doing, and a lot of people came to me to give some advice,<br>  but they seem to know neither what they were doing.
        Back then, there was no internet or any other source of information you could rely on;<br>  instead, you'd have tons of people claiming they
        knew everything to achieve your physical goals. Today I look back and see why I was<br>  struggling to get the results I was seeking. 
        First of all, the diet was not the best you could get, secondly the lack of places to <br> work out, and most important the supplementation
        because it is hard to get every nutrient you need from the crapy food we now have. <br> Here is where supplements come in handy. <br><br>
        
        However, the critical skill you would need to accomplish anything you want is being consistent.<br>  Unless you get on steroids
        or have fantastic genetics is kind of hard to get in shape on your own and at the same time maintain<br>  a positive lifestyle that
        does not interfere with your daily basis. We must be realistic and honest with ourselves. Now, if <br> your goal is to get a fit body 
        above average and be healthy at the same time, you have come to the right place. I am not here to<br>  promise you I will do the work for
         you. Although, I promise I'd be here to help you and give you the motivation and tools you need to<br>  get that Greek God body you are 
        seeking. It's not going to be easy, it's going to be painful, and you are going to feel like giving <br> up, but when you get to that point
         I'd be there to motivate you and tell you that goals are closer than yesterday, that one day a time <br> will give you a lifetime of well-being
          and happiness. I will tell you not to quit. Remember quitters never win and winners never quit.</p>
